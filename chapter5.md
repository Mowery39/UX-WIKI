# Chapter 5 Notes

- [Back To HomePage](index.md)

## Discovery 
Discovery is basically a whole flow of steps that starts with a kickoff and planning, then moves into interviews, research, prototyping, analysis, and finally presenting what you learned. I think the big takeaway is that discovery isn’t some rigid checklist — you can adjust or skip steps depending on the project, but you can’t skip the mindset of learning. Design and discovery go hand in hand, and if you’re not curious or willing to question your assumptions, the design just won’t be good.

## Kickoff, Preparation, and Pre-Planning for Discovery
Kickoff and pre-planning is basically where everyone meets up to set expectations and get aligned on what the discovery effort is actually going to look like. I think it’s important because this is when you ask questions, clear up confusion, and make sure you understand the hypothesis you’re supposed to validate. From there, you start planning the research and activities, knowing things might change as you learn more.

## Identify Stakeholders
Stakeholders are basically the people who either own the product, know the domain really well, or are affected by the changes coming from discovery. I think it’s important to identify them early and talk to the right people, since their insights shape the whole process and can even help you find more stakeholders by asking who else you should speak to.

## Create a Stakeholder Interview Guide
Creating a stakeholder interview guide is basically about writing out a script and questions so you’re prepared for those conversations before kickoff. I think the goal is to ask focused questions about past work, market context, blockers, priorities, and what success looks like, without overloading the interview with too many questions.

## Interview Stakeholders
Interviewing stakeholders is basically like user interviews, but more focused on goals, constraints, and the big-picture direction instead of day-to-day user needs. I think it’s important to plan enough time, ask around a dozen questions, and create a comfortable space so stakeholders feel safe being honest, especially by having one person lead and another take notes.

## Perform Secondary Research
Secondary research is basically using existing data and reports, like analytics or industry studies, to spot trends and patterns without starting from scratch. I think it’s useful because it adds context to stakeholder input and gives everyone shared facts to reference during discovery.

## Analyze and Synthesize Stakeholder Interview Notes
This step is basically about taking everything you learned from interviews and secondary research and turning it into something meaningful. I think using sticky notes to find patterns and themes makes it easier to connect ideas and figure out what really matters for the discovery effort.

## Kickoff Workshop
The kickoff workshop is basically where everyone involved comes together to align on goals, priorities, and what success actually looks like. I think it’s important because it helps refine the discovery focus using what you’ve already learned from stakeholders and research.

## Create Your Workshop Plan
This step is about planning how the kickoff workshop will run so it’s actually productive and not chaotic. I think deciding who should attend, how long it’ll be, and what activities you’ll do helps keep everyone focused and prevents future blockers from popping up later.

## Create Your Workshop Agenda
Creating an agenda is basically making sure the workshop has structure and clear outcomes instead of just being a long meeting. I think walking through users, interview findings, requirements, prioritization, and next steps helps everyone leave aligned on what happens next.

## Facilitate the Workshop
Facilitating the workshop is about guiding the conversation, managing time, and keeping people engaged while sticking to the agenda. I think even if cutting people off feels awkward, ending on time matters more and keeps the session effective.

## Review Workshop Outcomes
After the workshop, this step is about reviewing what was learned and making sure the team agrees on outcomes and next steps. I think reflecting on what worked and what didn’t helps improve future workshops without blaming anyone.

## Detailed Discovery Planning
Detailed discovery planning is basically where you take everything you’ve learned so far and plan the next deep dive into the actual problem. I think the goal is to clarify requirements and constraints so you can point stakeholders toward a clear vision of the solution.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
This phase is when more people start joining the team, so it’s important to reset expectations and clearly define who’s doing what. I think mapping roles helps avoid confusion and keeps communication and collaboration smooth as discovery grows.

## Defining Project Assumptions
Defining assumptions is basically calling out what everyone is guessing so those guesses don’t get treated like facts. I think documenting them helps uncover blind spots early and prevents bad decisions later in the project.

## Drafting a Project Brief
A project brief is a short but powerful document that keeps everyone aligned on what the discovery effort is trying to accomplish. I think it works best as a living document that evolves as assumptions turn into real goals and requirements.

## Crafting a User Research Plan
The user research plan lays out why research is needed, who you’re studying, and how the research will be done. I think being detailed here matters because it ensures consistency, clarity, and useful results across all research sessions.

## Delivering the Project Brief and Research Plan
Delivering these documents is basically a checkpoint to make sure the team and stakeholders agree before moving into user research. I think it’s better to make revisions now than realize later that the project went in the wrong direction.

## Facilitating User Research
Facilitating user research is basically where most of the discovery time goes, since you’re directly learning about users’ behaviors, needs, and frustrations. I think treating it like a marathon and having a research partner helps you stay focused and not miss important details.

## Prototyping
Prototyping is used to help validate your hypothesis by turning research insights into something users can react to. I think the level of fidelity depends on time and resources, but the goal is always feedback, not perfection.

## Concept Design and Exploration
This step is about quickly generating ideas through group sketching and collaboration. I think keeping things low-fidelity makes it easier to get honest feedback and iterate without people getting attached to one idea.

## Internal Concept Review and Iteration
Here, the team narrows ideas down to one or two concepts based on feedback and updates them. I think this step helps focus effort before moving into more detailed prototypes or testing.

## Usability Testing (and Iteration)
Usability testing is where users interact with the prototype so you can see what actually works and what doesn’t. I think even a small number of users gives valuable insights that guide iteration and stakeholder decisions.

## Prepare Prototype Presentation
Preparing a prototype presentation is about clearly explaining how the design evolved and what feedback shaped it. I think highlighting findings, risks, and recommendations helps stakeholders understand the reasoning behind the direction.

## Research Analysis and Findings
Analyzing research is basically taking a massive amount of data and turning it into something actionable. I think planning extra time for synthesis is important so insights don’t get rushed or overlooked.

## Picking Your Analysis Method
This step is about choosing a method to find themes in your data, like affinity mapping or quadrant analysis. I think the goal is always the same—organize information so patterns become obvious.

## Creating Your Research Report
The research report summarizes what the team learned and what should happen next. I think it should focus on clear recommendations instead of dumping every detail from the research.

## Presenting Your Findings
Presenting findings is the final step where you share insights and next steps with everyone involved. I think there shouldn’t be surprises since stakeholders have been part of the process the whole time.

## Optional Discovery Activities and Outputs
Optional outputs are extra artifacts that help align the team, like user stories, process maps, or roadmaps. I think you only create what adds value and helps move the project forward.

## Discover Your Own Way
This chapter is basically a starter kit, not a strict rulebook. I think the idea is to adapt discovery methods to your needs while keeping the learning mindset intact.

## What Does Success Look Like in Discovery?
Success in discovery isn’t just moving forward—it can also mean pivoting or stopping entirely. I think any outcome that saves time, reduces risk, and clarifies next steps is a win.
