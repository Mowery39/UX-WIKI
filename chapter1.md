## Why the book was written 

This book was written by Russ Unger and Carolyn Chandler to introduce UX design and speak to people who are naturally curious, passionate, and empathetic. The authors explained that UX designers care about how things work, how people feel, and how to improve experiences, which is why they’re drawn to the UX field. 

## The broad Definition 

The broad definition of UX design is the creation and synchronization of the elements that affect users' experience with an organization, products, and services using data-informed insights on user behavior and perception. Elements include the things that users can touch and even. It includes the things that users can interact with in ways beyond the physical, such as digital interfaces and people.  

## Don’t forget the Tangible 

Be sure to consider the effects of the tangible experience when designing digital products. The environment your users are working with matters, as to the physical products that affect the way your users will interact with your design.

There are other touch points to a product or company other than the US design. The best possible digital design can’t make up for a reputation for poor customer service or provide the satisfaction of well-designed packaging when a product gets delivered. 

## Our Focus

Basically, in this book, UX design is mainly about designing digital experiences like websites and apps. The goal is to make products that work well for users, while also meeting business goals and dealing with real-world limits like time, budget, and technology.

## About UX Designers 

Although UX designers are curious, passionate, and have empathy traits for that all designers share, there’s also a desire to achieve balance. Most notably, the balance between logic and emotion. 

It is important for UX designers to understand how to create a logical and viable structure for the experience, and needs to understand the elements that are important to creating an emotional connection with the product's users to create truly memorable and satisfying experiences. 

It is extremely important as UX designers to know the perfect balance that we need between emotion and the logical side. It is important that we use the logical side to bring ourselves back from the edge and keep our minds on the tasks at hand. According to the author, they say that in most cases, we will be working with a budget based on time and materials required to complete the project, and we need to understand that sometimes we need to fish or cut bait.
