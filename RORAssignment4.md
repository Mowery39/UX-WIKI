# Read, Outline, and Reflect on Chapters 7-8 of A Project Guide to UX Design

- [Back To HomePage](index.md)

## Essential Questions:

### What are the six basic steps of user research?

- I think the six basic steps of user research are defining user groups, planning the research, conducting the research, forming and sharing findings, validating user group definitions, and generating user-focused product ideas. These steps help me move from understanding users to actually shaping better design decisions.

### What are the steps of defining user groups?

- I start by listing attributes that help describe different users and then discuss those attributes with stakeholders who interact with users. After that, I prioritize the most impactful attributes and segment users into groups that make sense for research and design.

### What do these terms mean in the context of user research?

- **Primary user goals**

 - I think primary user goals are the main things users are trying to accomplish when using a product. Understanding these goals helps me design features that support what users actually came to do.

- **roles**

 - I see roles as how users relate to a product based on what they’re trying to accomplish, like being a customer, job seeker, or support user. Roles help explain different needs within the same user group.

- **demographics**

 - I think demographics are background details like age, income, or location that add context to user behavior. They can be useful, but I try not to rely on them too heavily so I don’t introduce bias.

- **experience**

 - I see experience as how familiar users are with the subject matter or technology. This influences how simple or advanced a design should be.

- **work attributes**

 - I think work attributes describe a user’s job environment, such as company size, role level, or work setting. These factors can shape how and why users interact with a product.

### What are a goal, an objective, and a hypothesis in the context of user research?

- I think a goal is the big-picture understanding I want from research. An objective is a specific, measurable step toward that goal, and a hypothesis is something I want to test to see if it’s true or false.

### What is the difference between qualitative and quantitative research?

- I see quantitative research as focused on numbers and patterns, like surveys and analytics. Qualitative research focuses more on context and understanding why users behave the way they do, and I think combining both gives the clearest insight.

### Describe three user-research methods.

- I think user interviews help me understand user attitudes and goals through conversation. Usability testing lets me observe users completing tasks, and surveys help me gather patterns from a larger group of users.

### What is a persona in the context of design?

- I see a persona as a research-based representation of a specific type of user, including their goals, behaviors, and pain points. Personas help me keep design decisions focused on real users.

### Why are personas useful?

- I think personas help keep teams aligned on who we’re designing for. They act as a shared reference point that keeps decisions user-centered instead of opinion-based.

### How do you create a persona?

- I start by gathering qualitative and quantitative research and looking for patterns across users. Then I synthesize that data into one persona per user group, making sure everything is grounded in real research.

### What is an IRB, and how does that relate to human research in a university?

- I think an IRB, or Institutional Review Board, is responsible for reviewing research involving human subjects to make sure it’s ethical and safe. At a university, IRB approval helps protect participants and ensures research follows legal and ethical standards.


## Reflection Questions: 

### Does user research, as described in Chapter 7, line up with how you have seen research/science done in the past? Why or why not?

- I think it lines up pretty well with how research and science are usually done, especially with starting from questions, gathering data, and analyzing patterns. The main difference is that user research puts more emphasis on human behavior and context, rather than trying to be purely objective or controlled.

### What do you think is one potential pitfall when defining user groups, and how could you avoid it?

- I think a big pitfall is relying too much on assumptions instead of real data when defining user groups. I could avoid this by validating user groups through research and being willing to update them as new information comes in.

### What is a qualitative question you could ask about someone's user experience with this book?

- I think a good qualitative question would be asking someone how the book influenced the way they think about user research or design. This would help uncover their personal experience, opinions, and takeaways rather than just surface-level feedback.

### What is a quantitative question you could ask about someone's user experience with this book?

- I think a good quantitative question would be asking how often someone referenced the book while working on a project or assignment. This would give measurable data that could be compared across different users.

### How can you personally practice building empathy as a design skill?

- I think I can practice building empathy by actively listening to users and focusing on understanding their goals and frustrations instead of jumping straight to solutions. Observing how people interact with products and reflecting on those experiences would also help me design with more empathy.
