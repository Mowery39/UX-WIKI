# Chapter 9 Notes

## Mapping Methods
Mapping in UX is basically a way to visualize how users move through a product and what steps they take along the way. It helps show where users might get confused or stuck and where there’s room to improve their experience. Mapping also helps teams see what exists now and what could be built better in the future.

## Site Maps vs. Process Maps
Site maps show the structure and hierarchy of pages in a website or app, kind of like an org chart. They help explain how content is organized and how pages connect. Process maps, on the other hand, focus on user actions and decisions, showing the paths users can take to complete a task.

## Basic Elements of Mapping
You don’t need anything fancy to make maps—simple shapes and lines get the job done. Using a standard visual system makes maps easier for everyone to understand. The Visual Vocabulary helps keep things consistent and readable across teams.

## Pages and Pagestacks
Pages are the basic units of a user experience and are usually shown as simple rectangles. Pagestacks represent multiple pages that share the same layout, like blog posts or product listings. They help show dynamic content without cluttering the map.

## Decision Points
Decision points show moments where users have to choose between different paths. They’re usually based on questions like whether a user is logged in or not. Labeling these clearly is important so everyone understands what’s happening at that step.

## Connectors and Arrows
Connectors and arrows show how users move from one page to another. Arrows usually point forward toward completing a task. Crossbars on arrows show when users can’t go back to a previous page.

## Conditions
Dashed lines are used to show conditions in a user flow. They indicate that something only happens if a certain requirement is met. This helps clarify optional or restricted paths in the experience.

## Tools for Mapmaking
There are tons of tools you can use to create maps, from professional software to basic presentation apps. Everyone has their favorite, but what matters most is clarity, not the tool itself. Even pencil and paper can work if it’s done cleanly.

## Common Mapping Mistakes
Messy maps can make your work look rushed and unprofessional. Sloppy connections, uneven spacing, and poorly placed text make maps hard to read. Small details like alignment and spacing actually matter a lot.

## Page Numbering
Every page in a site map should be numbered to keep things organized. Numbering helps other documents like wireframes and process maps, stay in sync. Without it, things can get confusing fast.

## Simple vs. Complex Site Maps
Simple site maps usually fit on one page and work well for smaller, mostly static websites. Complex sites often need multiple pages and even process maps to explain user entry points. The key is keeping everything clearly connected and easy to follow.

## Process Maps
Process maps (or task flows) show the steps users and sometimes the system take as they move through an app or website. They’re useful for understanding user goals, decision points, and complex logic before anything gets coded. Even if they’re not shared with stakeholders, they’re still clutch for thinking things through clearly.

## Using Process Maps
Process maps can be paired with site maps to show how users land on certain pages or how different personas move through a product. They’re especially helpful for visualizing conditions, like errors or success states, based on user actions. A little clarity here can save a lot of confusion later.

## Journey Maps
Journey maps visualize a user’s experience over time as they work toward a specific goal, including before and after they interact with a product. They highlight what users do, think, and feel, which helps teams build empathy and spot friction points. These maps aren’t static—they evolve as the product and user needs change.

## Creating a Journey Map
Journey mapping is a collaborative process that pulls in research, stakeholders, and team input. You define phases, then map actions, thoughts, obstacles, and opportunities across each stage. It’s less about making something pretty and more about aligning everyone around the user experience.

## Brainstorming the Journey
This step focuses on exploring what users are doing, feeling, and struggling with at each phase. Pain points often reveal opportunities to improve or differentiate the experience. Group discussion is key here, and nothing is off the table during brainstorming.

## Analyzing the Journey
After brainstorming, the goal is to identify patterns, trends, and repeated friction points. Clustering insights helps turn messy ideas into actionable takeaways. This is where the journey map starts driving real design decisions.

## Journey Maps as Living Documents
The real value of journey maps comes from creating them, not just presenting them. They should be treated as living tools that get updated as the product and business evolve. Alignment, buy-in, and shared understanding matter more than visual polish.

## Creating the Digital Artifact
Once insights are finalized, the journey map gets cleaned up into a digital version. Tools don’t matter as much as clarity—spreadsheets, docs, and slides work just fine. The focus should always be on collaboration and understanding, not the software.

## Other Mapping Methods
UX also uses tools like empathy maps, affinity maps, service blueprints, and behavioral maps. Each method helps teams understand users from a different angle. Together, they give designers a strong foundation for making informed decisions.
