# Chapter 4 Notes

## Solidify Project Objectives

Project objectives help keep a UX project focused and aligned with a company’s overall business strategy. Strong objectives are easy to understand, specific, and measurable, which makes them useful for guiding research, prioritizing features, and evaluating success. Clear objectives also pair with product analytics and KPIs (like acquisition, retention, or revenue) so teams can measure progress and stay aligned throughout the project.

## Understand the Project Approach

Understanding a project’s approach helps you know when and how to contribute as a UX designer and how to work with stakeholders. While different projects use different methodologies, most follow similar steps, such as planning, discovery, defining, designing, developing, deploying, and iterating. Knowing the approach upfront helps you adapt your work and make the process effective for both the business and users.

## Waterfall Methodology

The waterfall methodology is a linear project approach where each phase must be completed and approved before moving to the next. Because it doesn’t easily allow changes once a phase is finished, it can cause delays when new requirements come up later. This makes the waterfall less flexible, especially for projects where things evolve over time

## Agile Methodologies

Agile methodologies focus on flexibility, collaboration, and releasing work in small, iterative cycles instead of following a strict linear process. Teams work closely together, rely less on heavy documentation, and use frequent releases and feedback to guide the next iteration. Common agile approaches include Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe, and many teams mix practices from different methods to fit their workflow.

## Other Approaches a Designer Should Know

In addition to full product development methodologies, there are frameworks that focus specifically on the discovery, definition, and design phases of a project. These approaches help teams explore problems, clarify goals, and shape solutions before development begins. The time spent in each phase can vary depending on the team’s pace and project needs.

- The Double Diamond -  The Double Diamond is a design framework that focuses on exploring and narrowing down ideas in two phases. Teams first diverge and converge to understand the problem, then diverge and converge again to develop the solution. This approach helps teams avoid jumping to solutions too early and supports better decision-making.

- Lean-UX - Lean UX focuses on reducing waste by building and testing ideas quickly, especially in uncertain environments like startups. Teams create hypotheses, launch small MVPs, and use real feedback to learn and iterate fast. For designers, this means more sketching and collaboration and less time spent on heavy documentation.

- Dual-track Product Development - Dual-track product development runs discovery and delivery at the same time. The discovery track explores user needs and tests ideas, while the delivery track focuses on shipping features. This setup lets teams experiment without slowing down regular product releases.

- Design Spirit - Design sprints are a short, focused process—usually five days—used to solve a specific problem quickly. A small team brainstorms ideas, builds a prototype, and tests it with users all within the same week. Sprints are useful for deep dives and can be used within agile workflows or as a one-time activity.
