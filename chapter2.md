## Project Ecosystem 

Every project has its own unique challenges. For example, if you are designing websites or mobile apps, many of those challenges will involve specific features or functionality. 

All projects have a larger context that you need to understand and integrate into your planning. This context is called the project's ecosystem, and it includes the environment you’re working with, the general type of work you will be engaged in, and the people you’ll be interacting with.

## Identify the type of product

The different types of products are brand presence, promotional products, content source, task-based applications, E-commerce, E-Learning, and social networking. 

1. Brand Presence - every organization needs to have a site where people will land when they search for it. This is the organization’s primary brand presence. This is important because this is where people land when they want to learn more about the company. The brand isn’t something as simple as the logo; it’s the entire series of impressions that a particular person has about the company.

2. Promotional Product - Promotional products are designed to engage users with a brand experience that drives one or two specific actions, usually within a set time frame or targeted audience. Instead of just guiding interest, they’re meant to create interest and are often part of a larger marketing strategy across multiple channels. Some goals that designers have when working on promotional products are generating interest and excitement, engaging a set of primary user groups in order to elicit a particular action, and helping the company attain goals, being set against key metrics.

3. Content source - a content source contains a store of information, potentially in several types of media, and is meant to inform, engage, and entertain users. some goals for content source design is present the content that is the primary draw for first and repeat visits to the site, demonstrate accompany’s thought, leadership capabilities, support critical decision decisions among the user base, increase of companies, enterprise knowledge by bringing out ideas that may be buried with an individual departments, support users who are seeking information in different ways.

4. Task-Based Applications - these are task-based applications or basically tools within applications that allow users to perform a set of tasks that are aligned with their needs and, ultimately, with the company's business goals. Some design goals of tasks based applications are, enable users to do something they couldn’t do elsewhere, support, novice users, with easy to access instructions and visual prioritization of key tasks, support intermediate and advanced users with access to shortcut features and deeper functionality, reduce the amount of work needed from the user by making the best use available data, be designed and deployed with attention to the degree of change required to learn the new way of doing things. 

5. E-Commerce - E-commerce products usually combine multiple product types because they need to represent a business, provide content, and help users complete tasks like searching, comparing items, and checking out. They also often connect with promotional products and broader marketing efforts across the company. Some goals include explaining the model for the site, supporting decision-making as the user moves from learning to consideration to comparison to purchase, making use of points in the experience where cross-selling and upselling are possible, and finally creating a communication flow from the point of purchase through the point of delivery. 

6. E-Learning - E-learning products are a mix of content-based and task-based applications, where lessons are created by subject matter experts and learning specialists. Users usually follow a structured flow through the material while completing tasks, tracking progress, and practicing skills. Some goals include setting clear expectations for who the course is for and what knowledge is needed, breaking content into manageable and paced sections, engaging learners with hands-on or interactive activities, and clearly communicating progress and performance.

7. Social Networking - Social networks are mainly task-based applications since users need to find and connect with others, manage profiles, post content, and search. They also deal with large amounts of user-generated content and can function like a brand if the platform has its own identity. Some goals include clearly explaining the purpose and rules of the network, encouraging meaningful interactions through features like posts and sharing, helping users control their information and handle inappropriate behavior, and using community activity to highlight popular content and features.

## Consider different Devices 

When we design things, we need to consider different devices. For example, designing a digital experience for an interactive wall display is very different from designing one for an Apple Watch. Not only is there a difference in the size of the display, but there are often differences in how people interact with them. 

## Thinking Mobile 

When mobile is an important part of a project, it often makes sense to design the mobile experience first because so many users rely on their phones for everyday tasks. Designing for mobile first forces you to focus on the most important content and actions while also taking advantage of mobile features like touch, GPS, and device integration.

## Responsive Design 

Responsive design focuses on creating one website that adapts to different screen sizes like desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It uses techniques described by Ethan Marcotte—such as flexible grids, flexible images, and media queries—to adjust layouts and styles based on the device.

## Web Apps Vs Native Apps

Native apps usually offer a better user experience and make monetization easier because they’re built specifically for platforms like iOS and Android and live in app stores. Web apps, on the other hand, have a wider reach and are often more cost-effective since they work across devices and can be supported using the same codebase as other websites.

## Hybrid and Cross-Platform Options 

Hybrid and cross-platform approaches try to combine the benefits of native and web apps, but they come with tradeoffs. Options like hybrid apps, cross-platform frameworks, and progressive web apps allow shared code or easier updates, but each choice has limitations that affect design, performance, and testing, so platforms and target devices should be decided early.

## Interactions across devices

UX design isn’t just about desktop or mobile anymore, since products often exist across multiple connected devices that each offer different experiences. Designers also need to think about multimodal interaction, meaning how users interact through visuals, sound, touch, movement, and environmental data across those devices.

## Choose your hats 

As a UX designer, you often have to take on multiple roles depending on the project, the team, and how developed the company is with UX. Knowing which roles you are comfortable with and which ones you can learn helps you set clear expectations and communicate your responsibilities from the start.

## Information Architect 

An information architect focuses on organizing information so it’s easy to find and understand, including things like navigation, search, categories, and site maps. The role can overlap with interaction design or content strategy, depending on the project, so what matters most is using the title the organization is familiar with and clearly defining your responsibilities with the team.

## Interaction Designer

An interaction designer focuses on how a site or app behaves when users interact with it, including user flows, tasks, and interactions across different screens. They create things like task flows, wireframes, and prototypes, and think about multiple types of feedback, such as visual cues, sound, and touch, and the role can overlap with UI or product design.

## UI Designer

A UI designer focuses on the visual look and feel of a site or app, making sure it matches the brand and creates a clear, engaging experience for users. They design everything from high-level layouts to small details like buttons and states, often working closely with UX, interaction, or product designers, and in some roles, they’re expected to produce high-fidelity, production-ready designs.

## Product Designer

A product designer works across interaction design and UI but also focuses on how the product evolves through ongoing testing, feedback, and improvements. They are usually involved long term, helping shape features, releases, and strategic product goals rather than just designing for a single end date.

## User Researcher 

A user researcher focuses on understanding user needs by collecting and analyzing data through methods like interviews, surveys, usability testing, and product analytics. The level of research expected can vary by project, so it’s important to set clear expectations with both stakeholders and the team about how research will be used.

## Other Roles You May Play

In some projects, UX designers may also take on responsibilities from other roles, especially if those roles are not formally defined on the team. These can include things like product management, content strategy, UX writing, business analysis, or even front-end development, depending on the project and team setup.

## Brand Strategist and Brand Steward

A brand strategist defines and maintains a company’s brand, including values, messaging, visuals, and target audiences, while a brand steward makes sure those guidelines are followed during a project. As a UX designer, you’ll usually collaborate with these roles rather than own them, unless the project involves extending or redefining the brand, where closer involvement is needed.

## Product Manager

A product manager works with stakeholders and the team to make sure a digital product delivers value to both users and the business over time. They plan releases, use things like roadmaps and analytics, and work closely with UX designers, marketing, and developers to set priorities, understand constraints, and guide the product’s direction.

## UX Stratigist

A UX strategist focuses on making sure a product actually delivers value to both users and the business by using research, competitive analysis, and strategic planning. They help validate ideas, uncover real user needs, and guide decisions about what the product should offer, especially when there isn’t a dedicated product manager.

## Service Designer

A service designer looks at the bigger picture of how people experience a service across products, people, and processes, not just a single app or site. They use things like journey maps and service blueprints to find gaps and improve the overall experience, while also thinking about adoption, support, and how changes will affect users over time.

## Business Analyst

A business analyst focuses on defining and documenting requirements and acts as the main link between business stakeholders and the technical team. While they are not always part of the UX team, UX designers often end up sharing or taking on this role, especially on complex, task-based projects.

## Content Strategist

A content strategist focuses on making sure the right content exists, is structured well, and supports both user needs and business goals. They handle content guidelines, gaps in existing content, creation or migration of content, and coordination with the team so that content works properly within the system.

## UX Writer

A UX writer focuses on the words users see while using a product, like instructions, labels, messages, and notifications that guide the experience. If there isn’t a dedicated UX writer on the team, this responsibility often falls to the UX designer, so it’s important to plan for that work upfront.

## Front-End Developer

A front-end developer builds the parts of a product that users see and interact with, using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or frameworks like React. When UX designers or teammates take on this role, it’s important to coordinate closely with back-end developers and be clear about expectations, especially when building prototypes with real functionality.
