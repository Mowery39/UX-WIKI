- [Back To HomePage](index.md)

## Essential Questions:
### Who wrote this book and why?

This book was written by Russ Unger and Carolyn Chandle. It was written to introduce UX design and speak to people who are naturally curious, passionate, and empathetic. The authors explained that UX designers care about how things work, how people feel, and how to improve experiences, which is why they’re drawn to the UX field. 

### What does "UX Design" mean in the context of this book?

Basically, in this book, UX design is mainly about designing digital experiences like websites and apps. The goal is to make products that work well for users, while also meeting business goals and dealing with real-world limits like time, budget, and technology.

### What are the types of products described in Chapter 2 of the book?

The different types of products are brand presence, promotional products, content source, task-based applications, E-commerce, E-Learning, and social networking. 

- Brand Presence - every organization needs to have a site where people will land when they search for it. This is the organization’s primary brand presence. This is important because this is where people land when they want to learn more about the company. The brand isn’t something as simple as the logo; it’s the entire series of impressions that a particular person has about the company.

- Promotional Product - Promotional products are designed to engage users with a brand experience that drives one or two specific actions, usually within a set time frame or targeted audience. Instead of just guiding interest, they’re meant to create interest and are often part of a larger marketing strategy across multiple channels. Some goals that designers have when working on promotional products are generating interest and excitement, engaging a set of primary user groups in order to elicit a particular action, and helping the company attain goals, being set against key metrics.

- Content source - a content source contains a store of information, potentially in several types of media, and is meant to inform, engage, and entertain users. some goals for content source design is present the content that is the primary draw for first and repeat visits to the site, demonstrate accompany’s thought, leadership capabilities, support critical decision decisions among the user base, increase of companies, enterprise knowledge by bringing out ideas that may be buried with an individual departments, support users who are seeking information in different ways.

- Task-Based Applications - these are task-based applications or basically tools within applications that allow users to perform a set of tasks that are aligned with their needs and, ultimately, with the company's business goals. Some design goals of tasks based applications are, enable users to do something they couldn’t do elsewhere, support, novice users, with easy to access instructions and visual prioritization of key tasks, support intermediate and advanced users with access to shortcut features and deeper functionality, reduce the amount of work needed from the user by making the best use available data, be designed and deployed with attention to the degree of change required to learn the new way of doing things. 

- E-Commerce - E-commerce products usually combine multiple product types because they need to represent a business, provide content, and help users complete tasks like searching, comparing items, and checking out. They also often connect with promotional products and broader marketing efforts across the company. Some goals include explaining the model for the site, supporting decision-making as the user moves from learning to consideration to comparison to purchase, making use of points in the experience where cross-selling and upselling are possible, and finally creating a communication flow from the point of purchase through the point of delivery. 

- E-Learning - E-learning products are a mix of content-based and task-based applications, where lessons are created by subject matter experts and learning specialists. Users usually follow a structured flow through the material while completing tasks, tracking progress, and practicing skills. Some goals include setting clear expectations for who the course is for and what knowledge is needed, breaking content into manageable and paced sections, engaging learners with hands-on or interactive activities, and clearly communicating progress and performance.

- Social Networking - Social networks are mainly task-based applications since users need to find and connect with others, manage profiles, post content, and search. They also deal with large amounts of user-generated content and can function like a brand if the platform has its own identity. Some goals include clearly explaining the purpose and rules of the network, encouraging meaningful interactions through features like posts and sharing, helping users control their information and handle inappropriate behavior, and using community activity to highlight popular content and features.

### How do different devices influence UX Design?

Different devices influence UX design because they all have different screen sizes, interaction styles, and features that affect how users interact with a product. As designers, we have to adjust layouts, content, and interactions for things like mobile, desktop, and wearables, while also thinking about inputs like touch, voice, and movement so the experience still makes sense across devices.

### What are the different types of hats a UX designer might wear?

A UX designer can wear many hats depending on the project, including information architect, interaction designer, UI designer, product designer, and user researcher. They may also take on roles like brand strategist or brand steward, product manager, UX strategist, service designer, business analyst, content strategist, UX writer, and front-end developer, especially on smaller teams where roles overlap.

## Reflection Questions:
### How would you describe the tone/feel of the book?

I would describe the tone of the book as being conversational. I really enjoy the way it's written. It feels like I'm talking to someone in the field that basically giving me tips and tricks to use better UX in the field. 

### What other books that you've read would you say are the most similar to in how you use them to get information?

Honestly, I would say just any academic book. However, none of them felt like this. This one feels far more conversational, rather than the book just spoon-feeding me information. So, honestly, no book that I’ve read before in an academic sense feels like this one. 

### Is there a way you could improve the experience of using the book?

Honestly, just finding a way where I can listen to it instead. I looked up if there were any audiobook versions, and I couldn’t find anything. I really enjoy the way that the book is written so far. I did feel like chapter 2 was a little dragged out, so maybe if they condensed it into just main points, but to be honest, even that is a small critique, because they give a lot of information and sources of stuff that helps.
